# Spatial Analysis of Mortality by Cardiovascular Disease in the Adult Population: A Study for Brazilian Micro-Regions Between 1996 and 2015

This repository contains data from our paper . In this paper valuate the spatial patterns of deaths from CVD in the adult population 
(over 30 years of age), by sex, in Brazilian micro-regions from 1996 to 2015. Our main contribution was to study an important cause of 
death in small areas (micro-regions), taking into consideration space, as a proxy of socioeconomic conditions, access to health care 
and social norms that might affect CVD, as an important variable to understand changes in the CVD mortality.
